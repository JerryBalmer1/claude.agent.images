.SYNOPSIS
    The push tripwire: a commit landing on a long-lived branch arrived through the flow.

.DESCRIPTION
    THIS CANNOT BLOCK A PUSH, AND IT IS NOT PRETENDING TO.

    Branch protection is not available on a private repository on the free tier - measured, not
    assumed; docs/plans/2026-09-21-repo-policy/PROTECTION.md records three HTTP 403s against
    branches/main, branches/develop and rulesets. By the time this script runs, the push has
    already happened. What it produces is a red run, permanently attached to the commit that did
    it, dated, with the reason written out.

    That is worth having because the failure it catches is not a typo, it is a report. An agent
    pushing straight to main and then saying the work went through the flow is the exact event
    the sibling repository recorded nine times in one day (image.builder, 7cb86c5..a6b61dd) and
    nobody noticed until someone counted. A smoke alarm does not stop a fire either.

    TWO GATES, BOTH REPORTED, NEVER SHORT-CIRCUITED:

    1. The commit is a MERGE - two or more parents. Everything that goes through the flow lands
       as a merge commit, because config/repo.json -> merge.strategy is "merge" and squash and
       rebase are disabled at the repository level. A one-parent commit on main or develop did
       not come from a pull request. An octopus merge has more than two parents and still passes:
       it is a merge, and a merge is not a direct push.

    2. It carries a `who:` trailer from the allowed vocabulary. The automerge workflow writes
       `who: claude` into every merge commit body it creates, so a merge commit without one was
       not made by the automation either.

    The grandfather file is DELIBERATELY NOT CONSULTED. .continuity/trailer-grandfather.txt exempts
    commits inherited from before the guard existed, which is a statement about history. This
    script judges an event happening now. Sharing the list would let an old hash excuse a new
    push, and the exemption would quietly become a skeleton key.
